### Edge of Stability Normalization Experiments

This repo contains code for investigating the interaction between normalization layers, gradient scale
and the [Edge of Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00065). The implementation is based on
that which is provided in the EoS paper ([implementaion found here](https://github.com/locuslab/edge-of-stability)).
